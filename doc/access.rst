How to get access to the source code
====================================


General rule for all developers
-------------------------------

You are not allowed to publish anything with unreleased code on the master branch
or any other development branches without explicit permission (often through
collaboration) of the authors of that code.

In doubt ask in the developer section of the Dalton forum.


Procedure
---------

- The supervisor or collaborator who works within a Dalton development node
  should introduce the new developer in the developer section of the Dalton forum.
- The new developer should register at https://repo.ctcc.no/account/register.
- A repo.ctcc.no admin is then automatically notified and
  will enable the new developer and add him/her to the dalton-developers group which gives him/her access to
  the Dalton project and all sub-projects. Once this is done, the developer can clone the code using::

  $ git clone git@repo.ctcc.no:dalton.git

- The new developer can register at the http://daltonprogram.org/forum/ and contact bast at kth dot se
  to get access to the developer section of the forum.
